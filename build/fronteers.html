      <h1>Fronteers</h1>
      <p>
          Since 2012 am I a member of <a href="http://www.fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>,
          a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers. They
          organize monthly meetings, workshops and the annual
          <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres">Fronteers Conference</a>.
          If you are a Dutch or Belgian front end developer, check out the Fronteers
          website for <a href="http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten">meetings</a> and
          <a href="http://fronteers.nl/workshops">workshops</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          In this section you will find my notes of the meetings and the Fronteers
          conferences I attended.

          This was my first Fronteers conference. It was really awesome. Interesting talks, hang out with fellow front end developers, great location (Tuschinski Theater, Amsterdam). So enjoy the reading and watching the video's.
