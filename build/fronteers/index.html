  <p>
      Since 2012 am I a member of <a href="http://www.fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>,
      a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers. They
      organize monthly meetings, workshops and the annual
      <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres">Fronteers Conference</a>.
      If you are a Dutch or Belgian front end developer, check out the Fronteers
      website for <a href="http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten">meetings</a> and
      <a href="http://fronteers.nl/workshops">workshops</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      In this section you will find my notes of the meetings and the Fronteers
      conferences I attended.

          On January 8, 2013 there was a Fronteers meeting at Q42 in The Hague. Johan Huijkman (Q42) and Arend van Baarsen let us experience some accessability/usability issues. And gave us tips and advise.

        This was my first Fronteers conference. It was really awesome. Interesting talks and hang out with fellow front end developers. The conference was held at a great location (Tuschinski Theater, Amsterdam).
