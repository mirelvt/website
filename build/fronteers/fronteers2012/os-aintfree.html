The main subject of this presentation is how you can make money from open source projects. To get paid for the work you share with others.</p><p>If you want to do side projects you have to work on something that excites you. It is also a way to market yourself and to build and promote your personal brand. The community gets another tool for its toolkit. And most of these tools are free.</p><h2>The culture of free</h2><p>The culture of free, has the following components:</p><ul><li>you can view the source</li><li>there is no paywall</li><li>costs no money to...</li><li>you can learn for free</li><li>use the resources</li><li>and market your stuff</li></ul><p>It is the ideal environment to be creative.</p><p>It feels good to share your code with the world and you like it when others start using it. But there is a downside. People who use your code, they expect that you solve their problems to get your code working. For them it take 5 minutes to send the mail with a support question, but for you it take at least 30 minutes to help them. For David, these support questions were piling up.</p><h2>How do you deal with it?</h2><p>David asked himself "Why don't I put a price on my product?" Users have to make a value judgement, how much money is it worth for me.</p><p>There are people who are making a money: like the app store, WP premium themes. Is there a market for front-end development resources?</p><p>FancyZoom was one of the first pioneers in this field. For $39 you could get a commercial license. David made Isotope as a commercial fill-in plug-in for Masonry with the FancyZoom model.</p><p>David didn't like the available options:</p><ul><li>adopt fancyzoom license model.</li><li>still open source = on github.</li><li>github donation</li><li>Flattr</li><li>Generic PayPal donation, but not happy with those donation options.</li></ul><p>And started a company next to his agency for his side projects.</p><p>It feels kind a bit against the open source thought, but the results are incredible:</p><ul><li>Sold <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">Isotope</a> for $37 / License (now $25), responsible for 25% of income in 2011.</li><li>Able to pay off car loan and student loan.</li><li>Impact on quality of life.</li><li>At a cost of 20% of my free time.</li><li>Also the price allows non technical users to contribute to the product.</li></ul><p>Are support emails bugging you? Think about it. If so, ask support fee.</p><p>There is a huge market for commercial front-end dev resources. Free<xsl:text>&amp;</xsl:text>open source ideal doesn't scale. It is OK to make money out of honest work.</p></article><script src="../../js/base.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">var _gaq=_gaq||[];_gaq.push(["_setAccount","UA-35887478-1"]),_gaq.push(["_trackPageview"]),function(){var a=document.createElement("script");a.type="text/javascript",a.async=!0,a.src=("https:"==document.location.protocol?"https://ssl":"http://www")+".google-analytics.com/ga.js";var b=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];b.parentNode.insertBefore(a,b)}();</script></body></html>
