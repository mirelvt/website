    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Mirella van Teulingen and I'm a Dutch front end developer at
        <a href="http://www.dreamsolution.nl">Dreamsolution</a> in Delft, where
        I have the privilege to work in a team of experts in python, javascript
        and design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key areas of experience include HTML, CSS, Django templating. I also
        have experience with XML, XSLT, <a href="http://www.plone.org">Plone</a> and
        Zope Page Templates (templating used in Plone). The last few years I'm
        extending my knowledge with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>,
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, jQuery and javascript.

    <h2>Fronteers</h2>
    <p>
        Since 2012 am I a member of <a href="http://www.fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>,
        a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers.
        Since the end of 2013 I'm a volunteer at the workshops committee. We
        organise <a href="https://fronteers.nl/workshops">workshops</a> about
        front end techniques, which everyone can attend for a small fee.

    <h2>Personal interests</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not working or reading professional literature or fiddling in code
        I also have other, more common, iterests. To compensate being between 4
        walls all day, I mostly go by bike to work (20km total) and go to the gym
        on regularly bases. It really clears my head and gives me energy.
