  <p>
      Since 2012 am I a member of <a href="http://www.fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>,
      a Dutch non-profit trade organisation for front end developers. They
      organize monthly meetings, workshops and the annual
      <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres">Fronteers Conference</a>.
      If you are a Dutch or Belgian front end developer, check out the Fronteers
      website for <a href="http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten">meetings</a> and
      <a href="http://fronteers.nl/workshops">workshops</a>.

      In this section you will find my notes of the meetings and the Fronteers
      conferences I attended.

        This was my first Fronteers conference. It was really awesome. Interesting talks and hang out with fellow front end developers. The conference was held at a great location (Tuschinski Theater, Amsterdam).
